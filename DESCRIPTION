Description: Provides tools for discovering and evaluating biomarkers derived
    from ratios of composite feature sets (e.g., regional imaging measurements).
    Implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based search to optimize feature
    selection for numerator and denominator components based on performance
    metrics like repeatability, group separation, and sample size estimates
    calculated using linear mixed-effects models. Includes functions for
    multi-cohort data preprocessing, configuration, and results logging. 
    This package builds upon the methodologies described in 
    "A data-driven framework for biomarker discovery applied to 
    optimizing modern clinical and preclinical trials on Alzheimerâ€™s disease"
    (Llorente-Saguer, I. et al., 2024, Brain Communications).
